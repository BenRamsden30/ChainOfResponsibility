Driver Class - Handler - Authenticate
Base Handlers:
GeneralStaffHandler,
CleanerHandler,
BookingStaffHandler,
FlightAttendantHandler,
PilotHandler,
FlightControlHandler,
ManagmentHandler.


This code is a start and small snippet of the greater program. It only focuses 
on the chain of command design pattern which is being implemented to check
clearance levels of the user depending on their request.

It uses 7 different levels of user that can be checked. This can be easily 
manipulated to fit more access levels and be added to with ease. The 
authenticate class is meant to replicate user input and would not be designed 
like this in the greater program.

To Run the program run it from the ChainOfResponsibility.java file and follow 
the instructions that will be displayed in the command line at the bottom of 
the screen. Appropriate error messages and prompts will be displayed with
explanations when the code would be passing to another section of the program.

Each of the base handlers contains methods to check if the user has the correct 
clearance to carry out the action that they desire. The authenticate class is 
there to replicate the user input and is a place holder for the rest of the system.
